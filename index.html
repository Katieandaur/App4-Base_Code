Brief Description of Goal of Code:
To develop my own app and learn how to code to make my own diagnostic. Also, to learn how to add a picture to my survey. This will be extremely 
useful now and in the future as technology is heavily used and important in todays society. 
 
Known Issues:
No known issues

<!-- This is where I put the allergy and cold count from the instructions. The "behind the scenes" functions go in the script section.
This is where the app calculates the data and results and stores them. I had to input 4 * 100 as the way the app will calculate results 
because there were 4 buttons and 4 options for symptoms being cold or allergy like and * 100 since percent is out of 100. I had to add
percent signs after the allergy and cold percent so that the app had the percent signs given after the user got their results.

<!-- I added this style paragraph so that the app would let me display multiple pages within the HTML body. Also, added the code to be able to
add and display a picture in my diagnostic.
-->

<style>	
.body {
     margin: 0em;
}

.page {
    width: 100vw;

<!-- This is where I added HTML5, Javascript and CSS3. I used HTML5 when wanting to put things on the screen. Like putting the questions on the screen, 
Javascript was used for the buttons I made. CSS3 was used to make certain lines color and the alighnemnt of the lines. 
I also created my four pages in this body section. I used the code from the instructions and changed "id" numbers to the page they corresponded to
I also changed the "href = "..." to the number of the page it was on. As well as changed the yes or no buttons to their correct spots under cold or allergy. 
I also added an image under question 4 by going to the image right clicking and hitting "inspect" and the copying the code into mine.

<!-- I had alot of trial and error and picked out all the spots i had a mistake in and corrected them. I used "right click" on my app and clicked 
"inspect" to determine what was wrong with my apps when it was not functioning properly or the way I coded it to. I committed my changes almost after 
almost every little change I made to my code.
